# FDA202CRL

The 202 Complete Response Letters (CRLs) released by the FDA between 2020 and 2024 represent formal communications sent to drug and biologic sponsors detailing the specific reasons why their applications were not approved at the end of a review cycle. These documents, now publicly available in redacted form, encompass a broad spectrum of regulatory deficiencies—ranging from inadequate clinical trial design, insufficient efficacy or safety data, manufacturing and quality control failures, to issues with bioequivalence, labeling, and pharmacokinetic analyses. Although stripped of proprietary content, each CRL still provides detailed scientific and procedural feedback, often including requests for new clinical trials, clarification on statistical endpoints, or remediation of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) concerns. Collectively, this corpus constitutes a rich, previously inaccessible dataset that captures the FDA’s internal reasoning and evolving regulatory expectations—offering invaluable learning signals for sponsors, policymakers, and AI models alike.
